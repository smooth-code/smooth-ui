import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { Button } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

# Getting Started

## Installation

Install `@smooth-ui/core-sc` and `styled-components` from npm:

`npm install @smooth-ui/core-sc styled-components`

## Usage

There is no required setup for Smooth UI, it exposes ready to use components.

You can use components in your React app:

```js
import { Button } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

const App = () => <Button variant="primary">Hello world!</Button>

export default App
```

> Including `Normalize` is strongly recommended, see [guide](/docs-basics-normalize)].
