import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { Button } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

# Getting Started

## Installation 

Install `@smooth-ui/core-sc` and `styled-components` from npm:

`npm install @smooth-ui/core-sc styled-components`

## Usage

There is no required setup for Smooth UI, it exposes ready to use components.

You can use components in your React app:

```js
import { Button } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

const App = () => (
  <Button variant="primary">Hello world!</Button>
)

export default App
```

## Global normalize (recommended)

Even if it is not required, is recommended to apply a global normalize before using Smooth UI.

```js
import { injectGlobal } from 'styled-component'
import { globalStyle } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

injectGlobal`${globalStyle}`
```

If you don't want to use a global normalize, at least add `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`.
