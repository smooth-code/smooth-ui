# Add variants

Components like `Button` or `Alert` implements some `variants` based on colors.

You can use any color defined in theme as variant. If you are not confortable with Smooth UI theming, please read [theming guide](/docs-basics-theming) first.

## Example for Button

In documentation, you can see only main variants `Button` but it is possible to use any color defined in theme as variant.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    // Define a new theme with "violet" color.
    const theme = Object.assign({}, defaultTheme, { violet: '#EE82EE' })
    return (
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <Button variant="violet">Violet button ðŸ˜Ž</Button>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )
  }}
</Playground>
