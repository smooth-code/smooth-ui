# Custom component

Sometimes you may want to use a component but the resulting HTML tag is not the good one. Or you want to use a `Button` with another component like [the `Link` from React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link).

You can do it using two approaches.

## Use "as" property

Every components accepts a `as` property, it defines the base component used in each component.

An example of an `Alert` that uses `span` as a component.

<Playground>
  <Alert as="span" variant="primary">
    A span alert
  </Alert>
</Playground>

## Use "withComponent" helper

`withComponent` creates a new component with a predefined base component.

An example of `Button` that will use `a` instead of `button`.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const LinkButton = Button.withComponent('a')
    return <LinkButton href="#">A button as a link</LinkButton>
  }}
</Playground>
