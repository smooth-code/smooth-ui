# Extend Styles

Using Smooth UI, you have three choices to extend the style of a component.

## Override defaults in theme

To extend style, the cleanest way is probably to use the theming feature of Smooth UI. It permits you to change global settings that will impact all components.

Example of changes possible using theme:

- Modify `primary` color
- Modify breakpoints
- Modify form control margins
- Modify the focus glow on controls
- ...

See [theming documentation](/docs-basics-theming) to learn how to use it.

## Local override using props

Smooth UI exposes a lot of utilities on all components. You can customize nearly everything using props. See [System documentation](/docs-basics-system) to view all available utilities.

<Playground>
  <Button p={20} fontSize={20} border="2px solid black">
    A customized button
  </Button>
</Playground>

## Local override using `css` prop

[Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#css-prop) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop) both support the `css` property. This is a simple method to extend component style.

```js
<Button
  css={css`
    font-size: 20px;
  `}
>
  A customized button
</Button>
```

## Local override using style

Inline styles are still a good approach for a lot of use-cases. It can be used for very specific changes that don't need media queries or auto-prefixer. All components supports inline style using `style` property.

An example of inline style to change the `padding` of a button.

```js
<Button variant="primary" style={{ padding: 20 }}>
  Button with big padding
</Button>
```

## Local extend using styled

You can override any CSS property of the original component using `styled`. It creates a new component and doesn't affect other components.

An example of a `BorderedButton` extended from a `Button`:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    // import { styled } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

    const BorderedButton = styled(Button)({
      border: '2px solid black',
      '&:hover': {
        borderColor: 'blue'
      }
    })

    return (
      <BorderedButton variant="primary">
        A button with border !
      </BorderedButton>
    )

}}

</Playground>

## Extend components deeply

Some components are more complex than a `Button`. The `Switch` for an example is a component that includes several elements: a container, a ball... All of these elements have their own classes. To extend it, just use the browser inspector, pick the class and override it ðŸ‘Œ.

An example of a custom `Switch` with a black ball ðŸŽ±.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    // import { styled } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'
    
    const BlackBallSwitch = styled(Switch)({
      '.sui-switch-ball': {
        backgroundColor: 'black !important',
      }
    })

    return <BlackBallSwitch />

}}

</Playground>
