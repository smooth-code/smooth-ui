## Browser Support 

Smooth-UI rely on [browsers supported by Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/faqs#which-browsers-are-supported) or browsers supported by emotion (probably the same).

As Smooth-UI is using v4.x of Styled Components, which is using React v16.3+, so it will support same browsers as the version of React and Styled Components.

Supported Browsers: IE11, IE 9+ (with Map + Set polyfills), Chrome, Firefox (and derviatives), Edge, and Safari.
