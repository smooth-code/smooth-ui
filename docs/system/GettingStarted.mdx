# System

Smooth UI has a powerful style system that gives you a real styling power, it ensure a consistency in your design and reduce the amount of code to produce things.

## System Props

All Smooth UI components support system props, styling a component can be done by setting props:

<Playground>
  <Box
    backgroundColor="primary"
    width={{ sm: 1, md: 0.5 }}
    height={100}
    mx="auto"
    p={2}
  />
</Playground>

The above example create a red `div` with:

- A background with color "primary"
- A width of `100%` on mobile, `50%` on desktop
- A height of `100px`
- A padding of `16px`
- A `marginLeft` and a `marginRight` of `50%`

## Styled System

The system can also be used to create styled components, it is like an alternative to the traditional CSS. It gives you more power and more consistency by automatically reading values from theme.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const MyBox = styled.div(
      system({
        backgroundColor: 'primary',
        width: { sm: 1, md: 0.5 },
        height: 100,
        mx: 'auto',
        p: 2,
      }),
    )
    return <MyBox />
  }}
</Playground>

The above example create a `div` with:

- A background with color "primary"
- A width of `100%` on mobile, `50%` on desktop
- A height of `100px`
- A padding of `16px`
- A `marginLeft` and a `marginRight` of `50%`
