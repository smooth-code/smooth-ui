# Theming

Smooth UI has a powerful theming feature. It uses [Styled Components theming feature](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) or [emotion-theming](https://emotion.sh/docs/theming) under the hood. You can customize nearly everything using theme!

## Create a custom theme

The recommended way to create a custom theme is to create a file named `theme.js` that exports all `@smooth-ui/core-*/theme` and overrides only the needed parts.

```js
// theme.js
import { theme } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

export default {
  ...theme,
  primary: 'blue',
}
```

## Use your theme in your application

Smooth UI exposes a `ThemeProvider` that accepts a `theme` property. You must setup your provider before any Smooth UI component.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'
import theme from './theme'
import App from './App'

render(
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

## Default theme

You can find all theme values in [the default theme](https://github.com/smooth-code/smooth-ui/blob/master/packages/shared/core/theme.js).

Two ways to import theme in your code:

```js
import { theme } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'
import theme from '@smooth-ui/core-sc/theme'
```
