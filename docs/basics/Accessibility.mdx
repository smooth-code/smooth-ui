# Accessiblity

Smooth UI takes accessibility seriously. We do our best to ensure that all components are the most accessible for everyone and on all devices.

## Reduce motion preference

All components implement [reduced motion media query](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/), it means they respect settings of users.

`transition` mixin automatically adds the reduced motion media query.

```js
import { mixin } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

const AccessibleButton = styled.button`
  background-color: red;
  ${mixin('transition', 'background-color 200ms')};

  &:hover {
    background-color: blue;
  }
`

/* 
  CSS injected in the page will be:

  background-color: red;
  transition: background-color 200ms;
  @media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    transition: none;
  }

  &:hover {
    background-color: blue;
  }
*/
```

## Turn off all transitions

You can also choose to turn off all transitions by setting `transitionEnabled` to `false` in theme. See [theming guide](http://localhost:3000/docs-basics-theming).
