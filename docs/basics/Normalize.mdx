# Normalize

Smooth UI includes a `Normalize` component, it is strongly recommended to use it. Several global CSS codes are injected:

- Normalize abnormalities across browsers, see [polished `normalize`](https://polished.js.org/docs/#normalize).
- Enable theme fonts, by default [System fonts](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/) are used.
- Set `box-sizing` to `border-box`, [most of time it is easier for you](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/).

## Usage

Import `Normalize` from `@smooth-ui/core-sc`, then add it in the root of your application.

```js
import { Normalize } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Normalize />
      {/* Your code ... */}
    </>
  )
}
```
