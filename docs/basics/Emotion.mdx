# Emotion

By default Smooth UI uses [styled-components](http://styled-components.com/), but you can also use [emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

### Installation

Install `@smooth-ui/core-em`, `@emotion/core`, `@emotion/styled` and `emotion-theming` from npm:

`npm install @smooth-ui/core-em @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming`

### Usage

Import components from `@smooth-ui/core-em`.

```js
import { Button } from '@smooth-ui/core-em'

function App() {
  return <Button variant="primary">Hello world!</Button>
}
```

> Including `Normalize` is strongly recommended, see [guide](/docs-basics-normalize).
