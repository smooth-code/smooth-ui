# Introduction

Smooth UI is modern UI library for React, focused on accessibility, productivity and flexibility. It works with [Styled Components 💅](https://styled-components.com) or [Emotion 👩‍🎤](https://emotion.sh).

It is focused on developer experience, productivity. You can focus on what you want to build instead of on how to build it.

## Accessbility

Smooth UI components follow [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/). It uses the magic [Reakit](https://reakit.io/) to provide the best accessibility.
If you are interested by all accessibility features, [read the full accessibility guide](/docs/accessibility/).

## Productivity

Smooth UI is built by [Smooth Code](https://smooth-code.com), a dev studio specialized in React. We build new React projects every day. Smooth UI is the result of two years of research in term of being productive and building beautiful and accessible UIs.
Smooth UI does not contain a lot of components but has a powerful solid base with [xstyled](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/xstyled/). It adds superpower to your components with [system props](/docs/system/). You can build a complete UI without writing any line of CSS.

## Flexibility

Smooth UI is compatible with [Styled Components 💅](https://styled-components.com) and [Emotion 👩‍🎤](https://emotion.sh). You can use it all your React projects, with [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatbsy](https://gatsbyjs.org), in any application!
Smooth UI also have a powerful [theming feature](/docs/theming/) that gives you an entire control over the styling of the components, you can tweak literally everything!
