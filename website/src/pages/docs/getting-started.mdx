# Getting Started

## Installation

First you have to make a choice between [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) and [emotion](https://emotion.sh).
If you don't know either, it is easier to start with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com).

### Styled Components

```bash
npm install @smooth-ui/core-sc reakit styled-components
```

### Emotion

```bash
npm install @smooth-ui/core-em reakit @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

## Usage

There is no required setup to use Smooth UI, it exposes ready to use components.

You can use components in your React app:

```jsx live noInline
import React from 'react'
import { Button } from '@smooth-ui/core-sc'

function Example() {
  return <Button>Hello Smooth</Button>
}

render(<Example />)
```

> Even if it is not strictly required, it is strongly recommended to add `Normalize` to your application, see [guide](/docs/normalize/).
